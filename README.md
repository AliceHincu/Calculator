# Calculator
A calculator made in java using __Reverse Polish Notation__ (Shunting yard algorithm) and __REGEX__. Its purpose was to help me learn and understand better **OOP** concepts. The GUI is made with JavaFX.

# How does it work
The calculator takes the input (which is the mathematical expression) from the user, converts the string to a list using **regex** and then converts the list into a queue that contains the RPN form of the expression.

## REGEX
`ConvertorExpressionToList` - used for converting the string into a list using regex.
* The regex used for delimitating operands: `(\d+(\.\d+)?i?)`
  * `\d+` -> matches a digit between one and unlimited times. This is the whole part
  * `(\.\d+)?` -> This is the fractional part that can exist or not
  * `i?` -> matches letter "i" (imaginary unit) zero or one time.
* The regex used for delimitating operators: `(\+|-|\*|/|max|min|\^|%|sqrt|ln|exp|\(|\)|,|i)` (built at runtime)
  * matches one of the available operations

## Reverse Polish Notation
`ConvertorInfixToPostfix` - used for converting the infix form(a list) into a postfix form (a queue)
* This convertor is an **improved and detailed implementation** of [Shunting Yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20shunting,abstract%20syntax%20tree%20(AST).)
* Every operator and symbol has either common or special logic for processing the queue.
* Details about operators and symbols for processing can be found in `MathSymbol`. [PEMDAS rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#:~:text=It%20stands%20for%20Parentheses%2C%20Exponents,%2FMultiplication%2C%20Addition%2FSubtraction)

## Evaluation of RPN
The way each operation is implemented can be found in the `Calculations` class. Every number is perceived as a `ComplexNumber` and the operations are written for complex numbers. Decimal numbers are also accepted (or both at the same time).
* Operators are saved in Binary/UnaryOperatorEnum, where each operator is associated a sign, an operation from `Calculations` and a regex form for the first mentioned convertor.
* `CalculatorService` calculates the [postfix expression](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-postfix-notation#:~:text=In%20postfix%20notation%2C%20the%20operator,%2B%20c)
